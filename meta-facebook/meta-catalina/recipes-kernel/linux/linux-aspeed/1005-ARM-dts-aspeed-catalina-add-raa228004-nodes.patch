Subject: [PATCH 1005/1005] ARM: dts: aspeed: catalina: add raa228004 nodes

The Catalina dts file was removing some properties and compatible strings which
are not support in db-binding document and cause `CHECK_DTBS=y` check failed.

raa228004 nodes were removed due to compatible string not exist on upstream.
Add back raa228004 nodes back in this patch.
