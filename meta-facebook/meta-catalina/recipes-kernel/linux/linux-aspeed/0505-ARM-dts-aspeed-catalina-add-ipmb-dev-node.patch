Subject: [PATCH 5/7] ARM: dts: aspeed: catalina: add ipmb-dev node

The Catalina dts file was removing some properties and compatible strings which
are not support in db-binding document and cause `CHECK_DTBS=y` check failed.

ipmb-dev node was removed due to compatible string not exist on upstream.
Add back ipmb-dev node back in this patch.
