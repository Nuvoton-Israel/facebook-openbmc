Subject: [PATCH 10/12] ARM: dts: aspeed: catalina: enable uart dma mode

enable uart dma mode in uart3.

BaseOn: https://lore.kernel.org/openbmc/20230320081133.23655-1-chiawei_wang@aspeedtech.com/
The DMA UART driver has not yet been merged upstream, so the patch is currently only in the meta layer.
