Subject: [PATCH 6/7] ARM: dts: aspeed: catalina: add max31790 nodes

The Catalina dts file was removing some properties and compatible strings which
are not support in db-binding document and cause `CHECK_DTBS=y` check failed.

max31790 nodes were removed due to compatible string not exist on upstream.
Add back max31790 nodes back in this patch.
