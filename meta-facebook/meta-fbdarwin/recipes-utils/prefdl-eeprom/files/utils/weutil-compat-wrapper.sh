# This script makes weutil backward-compatible on DARWIN platforms, where
# DARWIN48V uses Meta EEPROM V5 and the new parser, but DARWIN uses the
# older prefdl EEPROM format and the old parser.

# If weutil is invoked in the old prefdl parser style, meaning the EEPROM
# target [chassis|bmc] is passed directly to the utility without the
# [-e|--eeprom] flag, then pass that target to the prefdl parser which
# supports both platforms. Otherwise, check if the BMC EEPROM contains
# Meta EEPROM V5 content at the expected 15K offset: if yes, then pass
# the arguments to the new parser; if no, pass the arguments to the old
